<h2>Overview</h2>

<h3>Goals</h3>

<p>The goals of this assignment are to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Understand and implement a circular doubly-linked chain of nodes.</li>
  <li>Gain experience working with Java references (i.e., pointers).</li>
  <li>Implement exceptions.</li>
  <li>Gain experience writing classes which implement Java interfaces.</li>
  <li>Develop an application that processes input commands.</li>
  <li>Get more practice with console and file I/O.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>During the Siege of Yodfat, in AD 67, Jewish commander Flavius Josephus and his 
40 soldiers were trapped in a cave, the exit of which was blocked by Roman forces. 
They chose suicide over capture and decided they would form a circle and start 
killing themselves using a step of three. In his account of the battle, Josephus 
states that either by luck or divine intervention he and another man remained until 
the final two and surrendered to the Romans.</p>

<p>For this assignment, you will write a program that simulates the Josephus 
counting problem using a circular doubly-linked chain of nodes. People will be 
added to the circle at the current position in the list. For each cycle of 
the simulation the entire list will be iterated over at least once and every k-th 
person will be eliminated. People will be represented by their first name using 
Strings.</p>

<p>You'll write a main class as your application as was done in 
<a href="?r=programs&programNumber=1">Program 1</a>. Additionally, you'll write 
a CircularLinkedList class that is used by your application to implement the circle of people. 
Your main class prompts the user to choose an operation that manipulates the circle 
(specified below).</p>


<p>Your CircularLinkedList class must implement the CircularListADT interface using a circular 
doubly-linked chain of nodes. You'll also implement an exception class used by 
your CircularLinkedList to signal problems.</p>

<h2>Specifications</h2>
      

<h3>The <tt>CircularListADT&lt;E&gt;</tt> interface</h3>

<p>A <tt>CircularListADT&lt;E&gt;</tt> interface is provided for you
(see <a href="assignments/p2/files/CircularListADT.java"><tt>CircularListADT.java</tt></a>).
The <tt>CircularListADT&lt;E&gt;</tt> interface is a generic interface that you will implement
in your implementation of a <tt>CircularLinkedList</tt>.
The interface describes the following methods, which you will implement in your <tt>CircularLinkedList</tt>
class.</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0">

<h3>The <tt>ListNode&lt;E&gt;</tt> class</h3>

<p>The <tt>ListNode&lt;E&gt;</tt> class represents one node of a <tt>CircularLinkedList</tt>. This class is 
also provided for you (see <a href="assignments/p2/files/ListNode.java"><tt>ListNode.java</tt>)</a>.
It has the following methods and constructor:</p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <th width="40%">Constructor</th>
    <th width="60%">Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><tt>ListNode&lt;E&gt;(E data)</tt></td>

  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><font color="red">Do <b><em>not</em></b> modify the <tt>Listnode</tt> class in any way.</font></p>


<h3>The <tt>CircularLinkedList&lt;E&gt;</tt> class</h3>

<p>You will write the <tt>CircularLinkedList&lt;E&gt;</tt> class to implement the
<tt>CircularListADT&lt;E&gt;</tt> interface. In addition to implementing each method in the
<tt>CircularListADT&lt;E&gt;</tt> interface also implement the following method.</p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <th width="40%">Method</th>
    <th width="60%">Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><tt>String print(int offset)</tt></td>
	<td>Returns a String containing the contents of the list formatted as follows:<br/><br/>
	<blockquote>
	Person1<br/>
	Person2<br/>
	...<br/>
	PersonN<br/>
	</blockquote>
  The list should start from the node at the provided offset from the current position and loop through the entire list until 
  every member of the list has been printed.
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<h3>The <tt>ElementNotFoundException</tt> class</h3>

<p>You will write an exception class to be used by your implementation of a <tt>CircularLinkedList</tt>
to signal when an element cannot be found in your CircularLinkedList. This class should be a checked 
exception. You may write any constructors and methods you deem necessary for this class.</p>


<h3>The <tt>JosephusMain</tt> class</h3>

<p>The application program, <tt>JosephusMain</tt>, creates and uses a
<tt>CircularLinkedList&lt;E&gt;</tt> to represent and simulate the Josephus counting problem.
 You will write code for each of the options
listed below. Your code should make use of the <tt>CircularLinkedList</tt> and <tt>ElementNotFoundException</tt> classes you have written, where appropriate.</p>

<p>The
<a href="assignments/p2/files/JosephusMain.java"><tt>JosephusMain.java</tt></a>
file contains the outline of the <tt>JosephusMain</tt> class. Download this file
and use it as the starting point for your <tt>JosephusMain</tt> implementation.</p>


<a name="main"></a>

<p>For this program, you'll access a file containing the initial list of people in the 
circle. The pathname of this file will be provided by using command-line arguments, 
similar to what was done in <a href="?r=programs&programNumber=1">Program 1</a>. When 
the program starts the first person added to the circle will be where the current position 
starts from. Each cycle will go around the entire circle at least once, eleminating every k-th 
person (where k is the step size). A cycle will be considered finished when one more person is 
eliminated after passing by the starting position. Therefore, even if the size of the step, k, 
is larger than the size of the circle at least one person will be eliminated each cycle. 

<p>The command options are:</p>   
<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0">
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <th width="15%">Command format</th>
    <th width="85%">Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center"><tt>a <i>name</i></tt></td>
    <td><b>A</b>dd a person to the existing circle. This person will be added to the circle at the 
    current position.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center"><tt>p</tt></td>
    <td><b>P</b>rint the circle in the format specified by the <tt>CircularLinkedList</tt>'s <tt>print()</tt> method. 
    You should start printing the circle at the current position.
    </td>
  </tr>  
  <tr>
    <td align="center"><tt>r <i>stepSize</i> <i>direction</i> <i>#ofCycles</i></tt></td>
    <td>
	<b>R</b>uns the simulation for the provided number of cycles using the direction provided to determine if the circle should be iterated over 
  forwards or backwards and using the step size provided to determine when a person is eliminated. The value for stepSize can be 
  any number greater than 0. The value of direction must be either "forward", "f", "backward", or "b". The number of cycles to 
  run for can be any number greater than or equal to 0. If any of these parameters do not meet these requirements then an error 
  message should be printed explaining proper use of the parameters. 
  
  When running the simulation each cycle should start from where the previous cycle ended. It should start by printing a message
  stating that "Cycle Number # Has Begun". The cycle will continue in the direction specified until the entire circle has been 
  traveled at least once. Every k-th person that is reached while traveling the circle should be eliminated by the person that came 
  directly before them and a message should be printed stating "[name of kth person] has been eliminated by [name of (k-1)th person]. For 
  example, for the given set { "A", "B", "C", "D", "E"} if the direction was "forward" and k fell on the fourth element ("D") then 
  the message "D has been eliminated by C" should be printed. If the direction was "backward" then the message "D has been eliminated 
  by E" would be printed since the k-1 person would have come from behind. Once the starting location is reached 
  the cycle should continue until one more person is eliminated. If the starting location happens to coincide with a k-th location 
  then the cycle is over. After a cycle ends a message should be printed stating "Cycle Number # Has Ended". 
  
  The simulation should continue until either the specified number of cycles have been run or until there is no one remaining. If 
  the number of cycle specified was 0 then the simulation should run until the circle is empty, regardless of the number of cycles it
  takes. At the end of each simulation a message should be printed stating "# people still remain alive."

<h2>Steps</h2>

<p>After you have read this program page and given thought to the problem
we suggest the following steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>If you are working with a partner, review the
      <a href="?r=coursework#pp">rules for pair programming</a>.</li>
  <li>Review these <a href="?r=styleGuide">style</a> and
      <a href="?r=commentingGuide">commenting</a> standards that are used to
      evaluate your program.</li>
  <li>You may use the Java development environment of your choice in CS 367.
      <em><b>However, all programs must compile and run on the lab computers
      for grading.</b></em> If you are going to use the CS
      <a href="?r=computerLabs">lab computers</a>, we recommend that you use
      Eclipse. You may want to review the
      <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/%7Ecs302/labs/EclipseTutorial/" target="_tab">Eclipse
      tutorial</a> to learn the basics. Note that on the Linux lab computers,
      you should enter "<tt>eclipse&amp;</tt>" at the prompt instead of what
      is described in the tutorial.</li>
  <li>Download the following to your programming assignment 2 directory:
      <ul>
        <li><a href="assignments/p2/files/ListNode.java"><tt>ListNode.java</tt></a></li>
        <li><a href="assignments/p2/files/CircularListADT.java"><tt>CircularListADT.java</tt></a></li>
        <li><a href="assignments/p2/files/JosephusMain.java"><tt>JosephusMain.java</tt></a></li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Implement and thoroughly test your <tt>CircularLinkedList&lt;E&gt;</tt> class and any
      additional supporting classes, including your <tt>ElementNotFoundException</tt> class.</li>
  <li>Incrementally implement the <tt>JosephusMain</tt> class as specified in
      the <a href="#main">main program section</a> above. Test each step to
      ensure your program is working correctly before implementing the next
      step. Create a small text file for testing (it will be easier to debug
      than larger ones) and make sure you test all the boundary and negative
      cases.  
      <a name="InputFiles"></a> <em>Download these sample genre files,
      <a href="assignments/p2/files/circle.txt">circle.txt</a> and follow the
	  steps in the <a href="assignments/p2/files/sampleInput.txt">sampleInput.txt</a>
      and make sure your program produces the <b>exact same</b> output as given in 
      the <a href="assignments/p2/files/sampleOutput.txt">sampleOutput.txt</a>.</em>
	  </li>
  <li>If you are not using the lab computers to develop your program, make
      sure you compile and run your program to ensure that it works on the
      Linux lab computers. You can compile your Java source using <tt>javac</tt>
      in a terminal window as in this example: <dir><tt>javac *.java</tt></dir>
      and the run your program using <tt>java</tt> as in:
